# Twitter-sentimental-analysis-on-women-harassment-
This work addresses the issue of women harassment on social media by conducting sentiment analysis on related tweets using various machine learning classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XG Boost, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, and Extra Trees. 
The study collects a dataset of 50,000 tweets, preprocesses the data, and builds a model based on abusive words related to women. 
The classifiers are then trained and tested, with performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score compared. 
The results show that the Random Forest Classifier outperforms others, achieving an accuracy of 82.81%, high precision (86.89%), and recall (94.64%) for positive sentiment, making it the recommended classifier for sentiment analysis of women harassment-related tweets.
The study proposes future work involving the development of an application using the Random Forest method to identify and provide support to individuals expressing sentiments indicative of insecurity or depression on social media.

To implement this study, begin by downloading the dataset, installing the required libraries, and downloading all Python files; subsequently, execute the code to conduct sentiment analysis on women harassment-related tweets using the specified machine learning classifiers.
